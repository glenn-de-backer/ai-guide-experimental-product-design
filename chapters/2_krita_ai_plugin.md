
# Krita AI diffusion plugin 

## Introduction

The Krita AI Diffusion plugin simplifies image generation within Krita, with or without prompts. What's great is that despite its user-friendly focus, it also allows for advanced features like utilizing ControlNet for greater control over your generated images.

In the background, it utilizes Comfy UI, a new graph-based user interface that offers power users a multitude of possibilities. Additionally, it seamlessly installs all necessary packages in a tidy, hidden manner.

## Requirements

While the plugin enables the use of online services for generation, this guide will specifically focus on local installation, which requires the following hardware 

* Intel or AMD processor
* 16Gb RAM
* Nvidia Geforce card 10xx or higher

::: tip
More than GPU speed of your videocard, Video Ram is also important. Especially if you want to generate higher resolution images. This can be mitigated by generating in lower resolution and use upscaling
