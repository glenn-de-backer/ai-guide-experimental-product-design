Although many students managed to install stable diffusion based on my previous guide, some found the process too daunting. Since then, significant improvements have been made, including the introduction of a Krita plugin, greatly simplifying the setup procedure.

Before, explaining how to set up certain models took many pages and involved downloading and using command lines. But now, it's much simpler. You just need to click on some buttons and check some boxes. So, I've decided to rewrite the guide and add some new things I've learned since my last presentation.

# Krita

Krita is a free and open-source digital painting software designed for artists, illustrators, and designers. It offers a wide range of powerful tools and features tailored for creating stunning artwork, including brushes, layers, and advanced editing capabilities. It's the Blender of 2D in the open source world. 


## Installation

Installing Krita is quite easy it's a matter of going to https://krita.org/en/download/ and click the Windows installer button

When you launch the installer, you'll notice it's similar to those used by many other programs. However, for clarity, I'll walk you through the steps
