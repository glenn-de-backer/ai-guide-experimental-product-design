# Introduction

## Why

A lot of people ask me why I spend so much time writing this guide, so I will try to explain it as shortly as possible

*First of all*, I'm an avid believer in the concept of **Learning through sharing**. It's not only for the benefit of others but also for myself. 

*Secondly*, I find it sometimes a pity that AI seems to be nothing more than generating media. While I discuss this in this guide, I believe there is a lot more to explore, particularly in the less glamorous aspects of AI regarding text models.

*Lastly*, it's also a bit of self-promotion without the stress of maintaining a blog where people expect new articles at regular intervals. This is also more manageable.

**Oh, and I find this also fun...**

## About me

My name is Glenn De Backer. I'm a final year student studying Industrial Product Design at Howest in Kortrijk. In my previous career, I primarily worked in IT as a developer. Over the past few years, I transitioned into a role as a creative developer, where I served as the Lead AI for a digital production studio in Bruges. 

Feeling the weight of years of stress that accompanied this role, I recognized the need for a change. Thus, I embraced the challenge of reinventing myself as a product designer. A highlight of this journey was winning the Rookies Award in the Industrial Product Design category in 2023.
