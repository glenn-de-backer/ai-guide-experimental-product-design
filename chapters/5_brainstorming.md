## 5 Why's

The "5 Whys" is a problem-solving technique developed by Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of Toyota Industries. It's a simple but effective method used to identify the root cause of a problem by asking "why" repeatedly until the underlying cause is revealed.

Here's how it works:

1) Identify the Problem: Start by defining the problem you want to address.
2) Ask "Why?": Ask why the problem occurred and write down the answer.
3) Repeat: Take the answer from the first question and ask "why" again. Repeat this process at least five times, or until you feel you've reached the root cause.
4) Find the Root Cause: Typically, by the fifth "why," you should reach a root cause that, if addressed, could prevent the problem from occurring again.
 5) Address the Root Cause: Once you've identified the root cause, you can develop and implement solutions to address it.

 We can ask ChatGPT the following question

 > apply the 5 why's on the problem of cats scratching the furniture and try to detect the root cause


Which resulted in the following answer

1. **Why is the cat scratching the furniture?**
Because it feels the need to scratch and mark its territory.

2. **Why does the cat feel the need to scratch and mark its territory?**
Because scratching is a natural behavior for cats that helps them maintain their claws, stretch their muscles, and leave scent marks.

3. **Why does the cat need to maintain its claws, stretch, and leave scent marks?**
Because these behaviors are instinctual and essential for their physical and mental well-being.

4. **Why are these behaviors necessary for a cat's well-being?**
Scratching helps cats shed the outer layers of their claws, keeping them healthy. Stretching maintains their flexibility and relieves stress. Scent marking is a way for cats to establish their territory and feel secure in their environment.

5. **Why does the cat feel the need to establish territory and feel secure?**
Cats are territorial animals by nature, and scent marking helps them create a familiar environment where they feel safe and confident.

**Root Cause:**
Cats scratch furniture primarily to fulfill their instinctual need to maintain their claws, stretch, and mark territory, which are essential for their physical and mental well-being.

You can even repeat the question multiple times within the context where it sometimes will try to get deeper!

## S.C.A.M.P.E.R

SCAMPER is a mnemonic acronym that stands for Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify/Magnify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, and Reverse/Rearrange. It's a creative thinking technique used to generate new ideas or solutions by encouraging brainstorming and exploration of different ways to modify or innovate upon an existing product, process, or idea. 

Each letter prompts a different type of thinking to stimulate innovation and problem-solving. It's a handy tool for sparking creativity and thinking outside the box.

Ask the following question

> Apply the scamper technique on a bookcase

Which gave us the following

1. **Substitute**: Consider substituting materials or components of the bookcase. Instead of wood, could it be made from recycled plastic or metal? Could the traditional horizontal shelves be replaced with vertical hanging compartments?

2. **Combine**: Think about combining the functions of the bookcase with something else. Could it also serve as a room divider or a seating area? Maybe integrate a charging station for electronic devices into the structure?

3. **Adapt**: How can the bookcase be adapted or modified to better suit its purpose? Maybe add adjustable shelves to accommodate different book sizes or incorporate hidden compartments for storing valuables.

4. **Modify/Magnify**: How can you modify or magnify certain aspects of the bookcase? Could you enlarge the size to create a floor-to-ceiling library? Perhaps add wheels for mobility or incorporate built-in lighting for better visibility?

5. **Put to other uses**: Think beyond its original purpose. Can the bookcase be repurposed for something else entirely? For instance, turn it into a display case for collectibles or a mini-bar for entertaining guests.

6. **Eliminate**: What elements of the bookcase can be removed or simplified? Maybe eliminate unnecessary decorative features to achieve a minimalist design or remove fixed shelves to allow for customizable configurations.

7. **Reverse/Rearrange**: How can you reverse or rearrange the components of the bookcase? Consider flipping it horizontally to create a wall-mounted display or arranging the shelves in a zigzag pattern for a more dynamic look.
