# More control

**ControlNet** is a neural network that allows extra fine-grained control next to text input.

You can define the pose of a character, use a drawing as an extra input, the silhouette of objects, depth,... and much more. 

Describing all the extra networks is a guide on itself, so I will try to give some practical examples where I use some of them.
