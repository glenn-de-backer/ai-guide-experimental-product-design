# Generating images

## Be specific when writing prompts

A good prompt is detailed and specific. Some (optional) examples:

* Subject: cat, woman, child, ...
* Verb: what is the subject doing, standing, dancing, ...
* Medium: sketch, photography, oil painting, ...
* Artist: Picasso, Da Vinci, Van Gogh, ...
* Quality: High definition, 4K, 8K,....

For more information I highly recommend the OpenART Prompt book available on https://openart.ai/promptbook

## An example of generating a picture

In the AI Image Generator dock find the input field with the text **Describe the content...** (1), fill in the text that describe the image you want to generate and press **Generate** (2)

## Be negative

You will often get things you donâ€™t want to have in your image or that come back a lot. You can mitigate this by adding negative
keywords. 

In Krita Ai diffusion this option is hidden but you can enable this. 

Go to the **cog wheels icon** (1) and click on it to open the configuration
