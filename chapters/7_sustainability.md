I also found out that AI can help with determine

## Sustainable development goals

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global objectives established by the United Nations in 2015 to address various social, economic, and environmental challenges worldwide. These goals aim to achieve a more sustainable and equitable future by 2030, covering areas such as poverty eradication, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, climate action, and more.

One of the things I found out that you can describe your project or service and ask ChatGPT which SGD could be applied 

> We have a furniture that is modular and can serve as a bookcase and a cabinet to put LP's in it. What SGD could be applied here?

1. **Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure:** Your furniture reflects innovation in design by combining multiple functions into one piece. This promotes efficient use of space and resources, contributing to sustainable infrastructure.

2. **Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production:** By offering a multifunctional piece of furniture, you encourage responsible consumption by minimizing the need for separate pieces for different purposes. Additionally, if the furniture is made from sustainable materials and designed for durability, it further supports this goal.

3. **Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities:** Modular furniture like yours can be particularly beneficial in urban settings where space is limited. By providing furniture that serves multiple purposes, you contribute to creating more sustainable and livable urban environments.

## circular economic framework

As ChatGPT keeps its context we don't need to describe our product again and ask the following question

> Could you apply the circular economic framework to our product ?

**Circular Economy Application to Modular Furniture**

*Design for Durability and Longevity*

- **Design:** Ensure the furniture is designed with high-quality, durable materials to withstand wear and tear over time.
- **Materials:** Use sustainable and long-lasting materials that can be easily maintained and repaired.

*Modularity and Repairability*

- **Interchangeable Components:** Design the furniture with interchangeable parts to facilitate repairs and replacements.
- **Repair Services:** Offer repair services or tutorials to customers to extend the lifespan of the furniture.

*Reuse and Upcycling*

- **Take-Back Program:** Implement a take-back program where customers can return old furniture for refurbishment or recycling.
- **Upcycling:** Explore opportunities to upcycle old furniture components into new products or materials.
