## 5 Why's

The "5 Whys" is a problem-solving technique developed by Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of Toyota Industries. It's a simple but effective method used to identify the root cause of a problem by asking "why" repeatedly until the underlying cause is revealed.

Here's how it works:

1) Identify the Problem: Start by defining the problem you want to address.
2) Ask "Why?": Ask why the problem occurred and write down the answer.
3) Repeat: Take the answer from the first question and ask "why" again. Repeat this process at least five times, or until you feel you've reached the root cause.
4) Find the Root Cause: Typically, by the fifth "why," you should reach a root cause that, if addressed, could prevent the problem from occurring again.
 5) Address the Root Cause: Once you've identified the root cause, you can develop and implement solutions to address it.
