# Research with ChatGPT

Most people rely on ChatGPT for the knowledge that is in it that can be outdated (certainly the case for the free model) or where the chat model gives sometimes the wrong information. 

## Hello context

I will start of with a small example. We will describe a woman called kate by adding the following to ChatGPT

> woman, kate, 41 years old, born in France  in march 1983, loves red color, likes to listen to heavy metal

It will answer with a description of kate that gives us not much new information but the context is set. 

We can now ask certain question of make relations with information that ChatGPT already nows.

> In the year that kate was born which historical things happened in her home country? 

Which resulted in the following answer, showing that it remembered that Kate is born in 1983 and born in France


*Historical Events in France (1983)* 

- **François Mitterrand's Presidency:** François Mitterrand was serving as the President of France. His presidency marked a period of socialist leadership in the country.

- **Social and Economic Reforms:** Mitterrand's government implemented various social and economic reforms, including the reduction of the legal working week to 39 hours, the expansion of social welfare programs, and nationalization of key industries.

- **Nuclear Testing:** France conducted several nuclear tests in the Pacific Ocean, leading to international criticism and protests.
