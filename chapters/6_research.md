# Basic market research with ChatGPT

Many people rely on ChatGPT for its knowledge, which can sometimes be outdated, especially with the free model, or occasionally incorrect.

One trick I've discovered is that every Chat AI maintains a context, keeping tabs on the information provided and, importantly, what you gave. You can exploit this to your advantage when doing market research. 

## Hello context

I will start of with a small example. We will describe a woman called kate by adding the following to ChatGPT

> woman, kate, 41 years old, born in France  in march 1983, loves red color, likes to listen to heavy metal

It will answer with a description of kate that gives us not much new information but the context is set. 

We can now ask certain question of make relations with information that ChatGPT already nows.

> In the year that kate was born which historical things happened in her home country? 

Which resulted in the following answer, showing that it remembered that Kate is born in 1983 and born in France


*Historical Events in France (1983)* 

- **François Mitterrand's Presidency:** François Mitterrand was serving as the President of France. His presidency marked a period of socialist leadership in the country.

- **Social and Economic Reforms:** Mitterrand's government implemented various social and economic reforms, including the reduction of the legal working week to 39 hours, the expansion of social welfare programs, and nationalization of key industries.

- **Nuclear Testing:** France conducted several nuclear tests in the Pacific Ocean, leading to international criticism and protests.

The CBI website (https://www.cbi.eu/) is a fascinating resource, especially for developing countries aiming to export to Europe However, its value extends beyond that niche. It offers a wealth of information ideal for conducting some basic marketing research.

The free version of ChatGPT does not support fetching from urls you pass, so we need to use workaround. Start by selecting the text of the report (You can do Control + A and Control + C) and copy it. 

![Copy the body text](images/chapter_6/cbi_step6.png){width=90%}

Go to ChatGPT where in the Message (1) you paste the text and enter.

Normally ChatGPT will respond with a summary that can be interesting, but the cool part is when you query this new knowledge.

### Experiment

We’ve only scratched the surface of what is possible. There are opportunities to add additional information from other reports, research insights, and to generate new ideas. It’s a matter of experimenting, trying new things out, but maintaining a critical mindset regarding the results. 

I use ChatGPT as an example, but in the meantime, alternatives are also emerging, such as Mistral, Bard, Gemini, and others. It’s sometimes really interesting to repeat this exercise with different engines just to gain some new insights that the others may have missed.

But always remember: 

**having AI at your disposal doesn't mean you can bypass the need for critical thinking**
