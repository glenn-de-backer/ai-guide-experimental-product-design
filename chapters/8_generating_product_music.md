# Generating music for product videos 

Creating music with AI isn't groundbreaking, but now we're reaching a stage where the music produced doesn't sound terrible. What's even better is that it can be generated online without needing Python or command-line scripts.

One useful application I see is for creating music for product videos. While there are many resources like Bensound offering free music, you often end up with the same tunes. Perhaps you want music with a specific vibe or lyrics that better fit your product design video.

::: warning
Most music generation services are still in beta and undergoing frequent changes. Look at this chapter more as an idea on how you can use them rather than a step-by-step tutorial.
